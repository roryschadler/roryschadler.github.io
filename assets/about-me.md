I'm a software engineer with a deep interest in applying AI and other
computational tools to improve drug and materials discovery. Well-designed and
powerful software can accelerate scientific discovery by enabling communication
and collaboration both between scientists and between humans and machines. I do
my best work at that intersection of science and software, and enjoy building
tools for researchers that are both powerful and easy to use.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer II at [Flagship Labs
97](https://www.flagshippioneering.com/), an early-stage startup in Boston,
Massachusetts. FL97's aim is to automate the scientific method, providing an
AI-driven design-build-test cycle for materials scientists and biochemists that
is faster and more efficient than ever before.

I am a proud Dartmouth graduate, with a degree in Physics modified with Computer
Science and a minor in Chinese language. I'm enthusiastic about solving
problems, using my analytic and computational skills to approach a problem from
many angles. I thrive most when given a hard problem and the freedom to solve
it.
