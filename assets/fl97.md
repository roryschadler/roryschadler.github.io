# Flagship Labs 97, Software Engineer II

## July 2024 - Present

At [Flagship Labs 97](https://www.flagshippioneering.com/), I'm building a
platform for automated materials and drug discovery, enabling scientists to
design, build, and analyze new materials and molecules. As part of the Data and
Compute Platform team, I work on a unified data plane for collecting, storing,
and processing data produced by our laboratory instruments, as well as a
scheduling and orchestration tool for automated experiments.
