# MaterialsMine, Software Engineer

## January 2020 - March 2022

While on the MaterialsMine team, I worked in two different capacities, funded by Duke University's Pratt
School of Engineering and the University of Vermont College of Engineering and
Mathematical Sciences.

- As a frontend engineer, I helped to rebuild and containerize the Vue.js
  frontend. I also helped to migrate and polish the application from a demo
  state to production-ready.
- As an intern, I wrote tools for retrieving and transforming data and metadata
  from academic publications and loading it into the
  [Whyis](https://whyis.readthedocs.io/) knowledge graph

[MaterialsMine](https://materialsmine.org/) is an open-source repository for
nanocomposite and mechanical materials data which leverages the [RDF data
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) to encode
knowledge and relationships in a computationally accessible way.
