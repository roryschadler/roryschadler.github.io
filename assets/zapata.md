# Zapata AI, Platform Engineer

## March 2022 - June 2024

At [Zapata AI](https://zapata.ai), I contributed in several capacities across
the tech stack and the organization, writing Platform microservices in Go,
client-facing web applications in TypeScript, and data processing pipelines in
Python. My projects included:

The Andretti Autosport/Zapata AI Race Analytics Command Center, an extension of
the Orquestra Platform on Andretti's trackside analytics truck.

- My work on this project included building live race data ETL pipelines,
  real-time ML model inference, and high-performance data visualization
  dashboards to support time-critical race strategy decisions.
- I was also the project manager for the engineering team, leading weekly
  check-ins, managing our backlog and roadmap, and coordinating with engineering
  and business stakeholders.

The Orquestra Platform, an all-inclusive environment for building, testing, and
deploying Generative AI-enhanced applications.

- I was the lead frontend engineer, building browser-based tools for
  collaboratively building, testing, running and managing remote workflows
- I helped to manage our cloud infrastructure, including our Kubernetes clusters
  and CI/CD pipelines
